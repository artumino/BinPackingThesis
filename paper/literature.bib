  abstract = {In this paper, we address multiple container loading problems, consisting of placing rectangular boxes, orthogonally and without overlapping, inside containers in order to optimize a given objective function, generally maximizing the value of the packed boxes or minimizing the number of containers required to pack all available boxes. Four techniques to enumerate the possible locations of boxes inside a container, some of them not yet tested in the literature, are evaluated. We also propose new techniques to obtain primal and dual bounds for these problems. In addition, we study the constraints related to box orientation, load stability, and separation of boxes. Detailed analysis on well-known benchmark instances shows that our method is very competitive, generating mathematical models containing significantly fewer variables and constraints than the traditional approach existing in the literature. We test our methods on five different benchmark sets. We provide a detailed comparison with different approaches from the CLP literature, proving new optimal solutions and improving the best-known results for several instances.}

This latter procedure is based on the Interval Graph representation of the packing, proposed by Fekete and Schepers, which reduces the size of the search space. We also introduce a general method to increase the size of the associated neighborhoods, and thus the quality of the search, without increasing the overall complexity of the algorithm.

  abstract = {Abstract In this paper, we propose to solve the three-dimensional single bin-size bin packing problem (3D-SBSBPP) using a simple strategy based on integer linear programming (ILP) heuristics, without using any improvement based on metaheuristics. We first propose an ILP that is converted into a series of three-dimensional single knapsack problems (3D-SKP). Then, the first tailored heuristic can be viewed as a hybrid approach in which both “selection” and “positioning” phases are combined. The first phase serves to select a subset of items where each of these items is susceptible to belonging to an active container. The positioning phase serves to pack a subset of items already preselected by the selection phase. Then, both phases cooperate till packing all items into their corresponding containers. The second heuristic can be viewed as an extended version of the first one. Indeed, before deciding whether the current container is closed or a new container is activated, “a local reoptimization phase” is considered. Finally, both proposed heuristics are evaluated on a set of random instances obtained by using the standard generator scheme of the literature. The provided results show that both proposed heuristics remain competitive when compared to the results obtained by one of the best methods of the literature.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a novel biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA) for 2D and 3D bin packing problems. The approach uses a maximal-space representation to manage the free spaces in the bins. The proposed algorithm hybridizes a novel placement procedure with a genetic algorithm based on random keys. The BRKGA is used to evolve the order in which the boxes are packed into the bins and the parameters used by the placement procedure. Two new placement heuristics are used to determine the bin and the free maximal space where each box is placed. A novel fitness function that improves significantly the solution quality is also developed. The new approach is extensively tested on 858 problem instances and compared with other approaches published in the literature. The computational experiment results demonstrate that the new approach consistently equals or outperforms the other approaches and the statistical analysis confirms that the approach is significantly better than all the other approaches.}

In this work we present a variable neighborhood descent (VND) inspired algorithm which improves the state-of-art biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA), proposed in [6], for the three-dimensional bin packing problem. The constructive greedy heuristic method to pack the boxes uses an integer sequence to establish the order of boxes to be packed. The presented BRKGA/VND variant fills the initial and mutant population based on sorted box sequences. The devised hybrid method shows significantly superior average fitness through the generations, therefore, solutions with high quality are found faster. The novel approach is tested with a standard set of 320 instances. The computational experiment demonstrate that BRKGA/VND produces equal or better results compared to other state-of-art algorithms proposed in the literature. The empirical data shows that BRKGA/VND hybrid variant systematically produces high quality solutions at fewer iterations compared to the results attained by BRKGA.}

  abstract = {We consider a real-world packing problem faced by a logistics company that loads and ships hundreds of trucks every day. For each shipment, the cargo has to be selected from a set of heterogeneous boxes. The goal of the resulting container loading problem (CLP) is to maximize the value of the cargo while satisfying a number of practical constraints to ensure safety and facilitate cargo handling, including customer priorities, load balancing, cargo stability, stacking constraints, positioning constraints, and limiting the number of unnecessary cargo move operations during multi-shipment deliveries. Although some of these constraints have been considered in the literature, this is the first time a problem tackles all of them jointly on real instances. Moreover, differently from the literature, we treat the unnecessary move operations as soft constraints and analyze their trade-off with the value maximization. As a result, the problem is inherently multi-objective and extremely challenging. We tackle it by proposing a randomized constructive heuristic that iteratively combines items in a preprocessing procedure, sorts them based on multiple criteria, uses randomization to partially perturb the sorting, and finally constructs the packing while complying with all the side constraints. We also propose dual bounds based on CLP relaxations. On large-scale industry instances, our algorithm runs in a few seconds and outperforms (in terms of value and constraints handling) both the solutions constructed manually by the company and those provided by a commercial software. The algorithm is currently used by the company generating significant economic and CO2 savings.}

The bins and cartons to be packed are assumed rectangular in shape. The cartons are allowed to be rotated into any one of the six positions that keep the carton edges parallel to the bin edges. This greatly increases the difficulty of finding a good solution since the search space expands significantly comparing to the 3D-BPP where the cartons have fixed orientations. A mathematical (mixed integer programming) approach is modified based on [Chen, C. S., Lee, S. M., Shen, Q. S., 1995. An analytical model for the container loading problem. European Journal of Operational Research 80 (1), 68–76] and numerical experiments indicate that the mathematical approach is not suitable for the variable bin height 3D-BPP. A special bin packing algorithm based on packing index is designed to utilize the special problem feature and is used as a building block for a genetic algorithm designed for the 3D-BPP. The paper also investigates the situation where more than one type of bin are used and provides a heuristic for packing a batch of cartons using the genetic algorithm. Numerical experiments show that our proposed method yields quick and satisfactory results when benchmarked against the actual packing practice and the MIP model with the latest version of CPLEX.}

The typology of C&P problems introduced by Dyckhoff [Dyckhoff, H., 1990. A typology of cutting and packing problems. European Journal of Operational Research 44, 145–159] initially provided an excellent instrument for the organisation and categorisation of existing and new literature. However, over the years also some deficiencies of this typology became evident, which created problems in dealing with recent developments and prevented it from being accepted more generally. In this paper, the authors present an improved typology, which is partially based on Dyckhoff’s original ideas, but introduces new categorisation criteria, which define problem categories different from those of Dyckhoff. Furthermore, a new, consistent system of names is suggested for these problem categories. Finally, the practicability of the new scheme is demonstrated by using it as a basis for a categorisation of the C&P literature from the years between 1995 and 2004.}
