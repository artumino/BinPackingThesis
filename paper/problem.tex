In this thesis, we address the Three-Dimensional Single Bin-Size Bin Packing Problem with Vertical Support (3D-BPPVS).
Starting from a set of items of different sizes, the goal is to arrange them in the least amount of fixed-size bins without any overlap between each other.
In addition to the standard formulation of the 3D-SBSBPP, three practical constraints are taken into account:
\begin{itemize}
    \item each item inside a bin should have vertical support, meaning that every item should be supported either by the ground or by other items in the same bin (see conditions \ref{support:area_support},\ref{support:vertex_support}),
    \item the cage ratio of each used bin should be maximized (see \cref{eq:cage_ratio}),
    \item each item can be rotated orthogonally along its vertical axis.
\end{itemize}

Given a certain set of items placed inside a generic bin $b$ of base $W \times D$ with the top of the highest item being at $z_b^\text{max}$ and the sum of the volume of all items in the bin being $V_b$, the bin's cage ratio is defined as \cref{eq:cage_ratio}.
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:cage_ratio}
    \text{CR}_b = \frac{V_b}{W \cdot D \cdot z_b^\text{max}}
\end{equation}
%A high cage ratio means that even if a bin isn't fully occupied, it could be used as a base for other structures. This property is desirable in some industrial settings.
We note that in a single bin configuration, maximizing cage ratio is equivalent to minimizing $z_b^\text{max}$. Finally, a visual representation of the cage ratio metric is provided in \cref{fig:cage_ratio}.

    \label{fig:cage_ratio}
\end{figure}

Vertical stability is usually ensured between horizontal or vertical slices of items as a constraint on the minimum amount of area which rests on other items (e.g., \cite{GZARA20201062,kurpel2020exact,paquay2016mixed}).
Specifically, given a support area threshold $\alpha_s$ and a maximum vertical gap below which an item can be considered as effectively supporting another one $\beta_s$. We define an item as supported if one of the following conditions holds
\begin{enumerate}[label={\textbf{Condition \arabic*}.},ref={\arabic*},leftmargin=*]
    \item the sum of the overlap area over the XY-plane with every other item on which it is resting is greater than $\alpha_s$ times its base area. (area support) \label{support:area_support}
    \item the number of its corners resting on another item is greater or equal to 3, and condition \ref{support:area_support} holds with a threshold $\alpha^\prime_s$ where $\alpha^\prime_s < \alpha_s$. (vertex support) \label{support:vertex_support}
\end{enumerate}
A visual representation of the conditions \ref{support:area_support} and \ref{support:vertex_support} of support is illustrated in \cref{fig:support}.
The maximum vertical gap allowed $\beta_s$ is used by the industry and other contributions from the literature (e.g., \cite{elhedhli2019three}) to account for errors in the measurement of the dimensions of each box.
The introduced tolerance also accounts for the fact that in a real-world scenario boxes are not rigid bodies and will have a certain degree of deformation.

    \label{fig:support}
\end{figure}

Given the definitions of our practical constraints, a conceptual formulation of the 3D-BPPVS is
\begin{eqnarray*}
    \textbf{minimize} & \text{number of used bins} \\
    \textbf{then, maximize} & \text{average cage ratio of the used bins} \\
    \textbf{subject to} & \text{all items are assigned to one and only one bin} \\
                                      & \text{all items are inside the bin's bounds} \\
                                      & \text{no overlaps between items in the same bin} \\
                                      & \text{all items have vertical support} \\
\end{eqnarray*}

To the best of our knowledge no formulations for the 3D-BPPVS exists.
In \cref{sec:milp} a mixed-integer linear programming model for the 3D-SBSBPP is presented and it is later extended to include orthogonal rotations in \cref{subsec:orthogonal_rotations}.
Vertical support constraints limited to condition \ref{support:area_support} (area support) are developed in \cref{subsec:vertical_support_formulation}.
Cage ratio is not directly included in the proposed MILP formulation since it was able to handle only instances of the problem with a single bin.
As previously mentioned, in a single bin setting minimizing the maximum height of the bin is equivalent to minimizing the cage ratio.

\section{Three-Dimensional Single Bin-Size Bin Packing Problem}
\label{sec:milp}%
Let $I = \{1,\dots, n \}$ be the set of items that need to be packed in a set of $B = \{1,\dots, m \}$ bins, each with fixed dimensions $W \times D \times H$.
Each item $i \in I$ is characterized by a given width, depth, and height $(w_i, d_i, h_i)$.
Let us introduce three continuous variables that identify the position of an item's bottom front left corner $(x_i, y_i, h_i)$ as seen in \cref{fig:coordinate_system}.
We can now introduce a binary variable $v_{b}$ takes the value of one if $b \in B$ is used and zero otherwise. Binary variable $u_{ib}$ takes the value of one if item $i \in I$ is placed in bin $b \in B$ and zero otherwise.
To check for overlaps, we introduce three sets of integer variables for each axis of possible overlap to determine if there is a clear order of precedence on at least one axis. This formulation is also usually used in scheduling problems.
Let $x^p_{ij}$ take the value of one if item $i \in I$ precedes item $j \in I$ over axis $x$ and zero otherwise.
The other two sets are defined in a similar way over the remaining axis $y^p_{ij}$ and $z^p_{ij}$.

\begin{figure}
    \scalebox{0.62}{%
    \input{Images/coordinate_system}
    }
    \caption{Coordinate system representation for a generic item $i$ and its rotated clone $i \in I^R$}
    \label{fig:coordinate_system}
\end{figure}

The 3D-SBSBPP can then be formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem:
\label{par:standard_const}
\begin{align}
   \min       \qquad& \sum\limits_{b \in B} v_b & \label{eq:objective} \\
   \text{s.t.} \qquad& \sum\limits_{b \in B}{u_{ib}} = 1 & \forall i \in I  \label{cons:all_items_in_bin} \\
                    & u_{ib} \le v_b & \forall i \in I, \forall b \in B \label{cons:items_in_used_bins} \\
                    & v_b \ge v_c & \forall (b,c) \in B : b < c  \label{cons:bin_breaking} \\
                    & x_i + w_i \le W & \forall i \in I \label{cons:inside_x} \\ 
                    & y_i + d_i \le D & \forall i \in I \label{cons:inside_y} \\ 
                    & z_i + h_i \le H & \forall i \in I \label{cons:inside_z} \\ 
                    & (x_i + w_i) - x_j\le W(1 - x^p_{ij}) & \forall i,j \in I \label{cons:x_prec_1} \\
                    & x_j - (x_i + w_i) + 1 \le W x^p_{ij} & \forall i,j \in I \label{cons:x_prec_2} \\
                    & (y_i + d_i) - y_j \le D(1 - y^p_{ij}) & \forall i,j \in I \label{cons:y_prec_1} \\
                    & y_j - (y_i + d_i) + 1 \le D y^p_{ij} & \forall i,j \in I \label{cons:y_prec_2} \\
                    & (z_i + h_i) - z_j\le H(1 - z^p_{ij}) & \forall i,j \in I \label{cons:z_prec_1} \\
                    & z_j - (z_i + h_i) + 1 \le H z^p_{ij} & \forall i,j \in I \label{cons:z_prec_2} \\
                    & x^p_{ij} + x^p_{ji} + y^p_{ij} + y^p_{ji} + z^p_{ij} + z^p_{ji} \ge u_{ib} + u_{jb} - 1 & \forall i,j \in I, \forall b \in B \label{cons:no_overlap}
\end{align}

The objective function \ref{eq:objective} seeks to minimize the number of opened bins.
Constraints \ref{cons:all_items_in_bin} ensure that each item is packed in one and only one bin, while constraints \ref{cons:items_in_used_bins} ensure that items are only packed in bins used in the solution.
Since the solution has many symmetries with respect to the number of bins, symmetry-breaking constraints \ref{cons:bin_breaking} are added on the opening of bins to improve solution times.
Each item is also ensured to be placed inside the bin thanks to constraints \ref{cons:inside_x} to \ref{cons:inside_z}.
Constraints \ref{cons:x_prec_1} to \ref{cons:z_prec_2} are used to define the precedence binary variables $x^p_{ij}$, $y^p_{ij}$, $z^p_{ij}$ over each axis. Given that on axis $x$ item $i \in I$ precedes an item $j \in I$ if $x_i + w_i \le x_j$.
Constraints \ref{cons:no_overlap} then ensure that if two items are in the same bin, there needs to be at least one axis with a clear order of precedence; otherwise, the two items would overlap.

\section{Three-Dimensional Bin Packing Problem with Vertical Support}
In this section we extend the 3D-SBSBPP formulation of \cref{sec:milp} with constraints to introduce rotations of items and vertical support. Since our model only handles small instances we will use it in a single bin setting so, to account for the cage ratio, we change objective function \ref{eq:objective} with \ref{eq:objective_2}.
This allows us to define a proxy of the 3D-BPPVS that is valid for the single bin case.
We also introduce an additional continuous variable $z_b^\text{max}$ that takes the value of the maximum height used in bin $b \in B$.
The proxy problem formulation than becomes:
\begin{align}
    \min       \qquad& \sum\limits_{b \in B} (H v_b + z^{max}_b) & \label{eq:objective_2} \\
    \text{s.t.} \qquad& \text{(\ref{cons:all_items_in_bin}) to (\ref{cons:no_overlap})} \notag \\ 
                     & z^{max}_b \ge (z_i + h_i) - H(1-u_{ib}) & \forall i \in I, \forall b \in B \label{cons:maxz}
\end{align}
Where the objective function \ref{eq:objective_2} seeks to minimize the number of opened bins and the maximum height at which items were placed across bins and the value of $z^{max}_b$ is forced to converge to the maximum height of a given bin due to constraints \ref{cons:maxz}.
As previously noted, in a single bin configuration, since all the volume mass is concentrated inside one bin, objective \ref{eq:objective_2} also maximizes the cage ratio.
\subsection*{Orthogonal rotations}
\label{subsec:orthogonal_rotations}%

Let us extend the definition of the problem without rotations with a new formulation that allows $90$ degrees rotations of each item.
Let $I = I^O \cup I^R$ be the new set of items where $I^O$ is the set of original non-rotated items, and $I^R$ is the set of items rotated by $90$ degrees.
Given the set of tuples $(i, j) \in I^{OR}$ where $i$ is the original item with dimensions $(w_i, d_i, h_i)$ and $j$ is the corresponding rotated clone with dimensions $(w_j, d_j, h_j) = (d_i, w_i, h_i)$, we rewrite constraints \ref{cons:all_items_in_bin} as \ref{cons:all_items_in_bin_with_rotation} to force only one of them to be part of the solution.

\begin{align}
    & \sum\limits_{b \in B} u_{ib} + \sum\limits_{b \in B} u_{jb} = 1 & \forall (i, j) \in I^{OR} \label{cons:all_items_in_bin_with_rotation}
\end{align}

\subsection*{Discrete vertical support}
\label{subsec:vertical_support_formulation}%

We now extend the model to address the constraint of vertical support.
In the literature, some mathematical formulations tackle the concept of area support and, in some cases, vertex support. For example, in \cite{GZARA20201062} a second-order cone programming formulation of the support constraint was used but was limited to the problem of spacing between layers with one of them being fixed in position relative to the other. A similar formulation would lead to a non-linear support constraint in our case.
By introducing a discretization over the XY-plane a linear version of the constraint can be formulated similar to the one proposed in \cite{kurpel2020exact} without the need to discretize the z-axis as well.

Let us introduce some additional parameters to the model, let $0 \le \alpha_s \le 1$ be the amount of area that an item needs to have supported by other items (condition \ref{support:area_support}). Let $\beta_s$ be the tolerance to consider one item as being close enough to support another item (as seen in \cref{fig:support}).
In addition to the support parameters, a parameter $\delta$, which represents the discretization unit used to partition the XY-plane, is given. Let $I^B$ be the set of all the tuples $(i, j, b)$ such that $(i,j) \in I \land i \neq j$ and $b \in B$.
We can now compute a few additional parameters that we will use to reduce the number of constraints evaluated by the model. Let $\gamma$ be the maximum size over a dimension on the XY-plane between all the items as \cref{eq:gamma_max_dim}, and let $\Delta$ be the set of all possible distances between the origins of two items along one discretized axis as \cref{eq:Delta_possible_diffs}.
\begin{align}
    \gamma = \max_{\forall i \in I}\{ w_i, d_i \} \label{eq:gamma_max_dim} \\
    \Delta =  \left[ - \left\lfloor \frac{ \gamma }{\delta} \right\rfloor, \left\lfloor \frac{ \gamma }{\delta} \right\rfloor \right] \label{eq:Delta_possible_diffs}
\end{align}
Let $O(i, j, h, k) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$ be a function that computes the amount of overlap between two items $(i,j) \in I$ given the discretized distance between each other $(h, k) \in \Delta$ such that $x_j = x_i + \delta h$ and $y_j = y_i + \delta k$ which returns the area of overlap or 0 otherwise.

Additional new variables need to be added to the ones of the original model, let $s_{ij}$ be a set of binary variables which will assume value 1 if item $i \in I$ can offer support to item $j \in I$ and 0 otherwise. A new set of binary variables $z^c_{ij}$ will be 1 if item $i \in I$ is close w.r.t. the z-axis to item $j \in I$, which would mean that $z_j - (z_i + h_i) \le \beta_s$, and 0 otherwise.
Let us then introduce a new set of binary variables $g_i$ which will assume value 1 if item $i \in I$ will be on the ground or 0 otherwise. A set of binary variables $s^{kh}_{i j b}$ will assume value 1 if item $i \in I$ will receive support from item $j \in I$ and both items will be placed in bin $b \in B$ with a discretized distance of $(k, h) \in \Delta$ between each other and 0 otherwise.

Given all the additional parameters and variables introduced, we can give a new formulation of the model with the addition of the following constraints:
\label{par:support_const}
\begin{align}
    \min       \qquad   & \sum\limits_{b \in B} (H v_b + z^{max}_b) \notag \\
    \text{s.t.} \qquad  & \text{(\ref{cons:items_in_used_bins}) to (\ref{cons:no_overlap}), (\ref{cons:maxz}), (\ref{cons:all_items_in_bin_with_rotation})} \notag \\ 
                        & z_j - (z_i + h_i) \le \beta_s + H (1 - z^c_{ij}) & \forall (i, j) \in I : i \neq j \label{cons:z_close_1} \\
                        & z_j - (z_i + h_i) \ge -\beta_s - H (1 - z^c_{ij}) & \forall (i, j) \in I : i \neq j \label{cons:z_close_2} \\
                        & s_{ij} \le z^p_{ij} & \forall (i, j) \in I  \label{cons:supporting_1} \\
                        & s_{ij} \le z^c_{ij} & \forall (i, j) \in I  \label{cons:supporting_2} \\
                        & s_{ij} \ge z^p_{ij} + z^c_{ij} - 2 & \forall (i, j) \in I : i \neq j \label{cons:supporting} \\
                        & \sum\limits_{j \in I}{s_{ij}} \le \sum\limits_{b \in B}{u_{ib}} & \forall i \in I  \label{cons:support_comes_from_placed} \\
                        & z_i \le H(1 - g_i) & \forall i \in I \label{cons:grounded} \\
                        & \sum\limits_{(k, h) \in \Delta, b \in B : O(i, j, k, h) \neq 0} s^{k h}_{i j b} \le s_{ij} & \forall (i, j) \in I \label{cons:discretized_support_same} \\
                        & \sum\limits_{(k, h) \in \Delta : O(i, j, k, h) \neq 0} s^{k h}_{i j b} \le u_{ib} & \forall (i, j, b) \in I^B \label{cons:discretized_support_right_bin_i} \\
                        & \sum\limits_{(k, h) \in \Delta : O(i, j, k, h) \neq 0} s^{k h}_{i j b} \le u_{jb} & \forall (i, j, b) \in I^B \label{cons:discretized_support_right_bin_j}
\end{align}
Constraints \ref{cons:z_close_1} and \ref{cons:z_close_2} ensure that $z^c_{ij}$ is forced to 1 only when the distance over the z-axis between item $i$ and item $j$ is within the range $[-\beta_s, \beta_s]$.
The value of $s_{ij}$ is then assigned to the logical equation $z^p_{ij} \land z^c_{ij}$ thanks to constraints \ref{cons:supporting_1} to \ref{cons:supporting}.
Since some items could be left out of the solution due to the formulation of orthogonal rotations, we also ensure that support can only come from placed items thanks to constraints \ref{cons:support_comes_from_placed}.
Constraints \ref{cons:grounded} ensure that $g_i$ will assume value 1 if item $i$ is on the ground
Constraints \ref{cons:discretized_support_same} to \ref{cons:discretized_support_right_bin_j} ensure that if a discretized support decision $s_{ijb}^{hk}$ is 1 then every subscript of that variable must be true in the non-discretized model, so item $i$ can give discretized support to item $j$ in bin $b$ if both items are assinged to bin $b$ and if $i$ can give support to item $j$. They also force the selection of only one possible combination of $(h,k) \in \Delta$ for which $i$ gives support to $j$ in bin $b$.

We then define a set of constraints which given a discretized placement $s^{k h}_{i j b}$ limit the distance between $i$ and $j$ to a given continuous region in space delimited by a square of the dimension of our discretization unit $\delta$.
Given every tuple of possible discretized distances between items $ (k, h) \in \Delta$ and every tuple of different pairs of items in the same bin $(i, j, b) \in I^B$ such they have a non-zero discretized overlap over the XY-plane ($O(i, j, k, h) \neq 0$).
The resulting constraints are defined in (\ref{cons:discretized_support_limit_x_1}) to (\ref{cons:discretized_support_limit_y_2}).
\begin{align}
    & x_j - x_i \ge \gamma k - 2W( 1 - s^{k h}_{i j b}) &  \label{cons:discretized_support_limit_x_1} \\
    & x_j - x_i \le \gamma (k + 1) + 2W( 1 - s^{k h}_{i j b}) &  \label{cons:discretized_support_limit_x_2} \\
    & y_j - y_i \ge \gamma h - 2D( 1 - s^{k h}_{i j b}) &  \label{cons:discretized_support_limit_y_1} \\
    & y_j - y_i \le \gamma (h + 1) + 2D( 1 - s^{k h}_{i j b}) &  \label{cons:discretized_support_limit_y_2}
\end{align}

We then introduce feasibility constraints ensuring that every item that is not on the ground is supported by other items placed beneath it by at least $\alpha_s$ times its area, which corresponds to condition \ref{support:area_support} of the practical constraint of vertical support.
\begin{eqnarray}
    & \sum\limits_{(k, h) \in \Delta, b \in B, j \in I : i \neq j \land O(i, j, k, h) \neq 0}{ O(i, j, k, h)s^{k h}_{j i b}} \ge \alpha_s w_i d_i - w_i d_i g_i & \forall i \in I \label{cons:every_item_is_supported}
\end{eqnarray}

We note that every combination of $(i,j,b) \in I^B$ and $(h,k) \in \Delta$ where $O(i, j, k, h) = 0$ do not contribute to the support constraint. Thus, we can omit them from the formulation of the problem to reduce the number of constraints.
