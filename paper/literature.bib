Four techniques to enumerate the possible locations of boxes inside a container, some of them not yet tested in the literature, are evaluated. We also propose new techniques to obtain primal and dual bounds for these problems. In addition, we study the constraints related to box orientation, load stability, and separation of boxes. Detailed analysis on well-known benchmark instances shows that our method is very competitive, generating mathematical models containing significantly fewer variables and constraints than the traditional approach existing in the literature. We test our methods on five different benchmark sets. We provide a detailed comparison with different approaches from the CLP literature, proving new optimal solutions and improving the best-known results for several instances.}

  abstract = {Abstract In this paper, we propose to solve the three-dimensional single bin-size bin packing problem (3D-SBSBPP) using a simple strategy based on integer linear programming (ILP) heuristics, without using any improvement based on metaheuristics. We first propose an ILP that is converted into a series of three-dimensional single knapsack problems (3D-SKP). Then, the first tailored heuristic can be viewed as a hybrid approach in which both “selection” and “positioning” phases are combined. The first phase serves to select a subset of items where each of these items is susceptible to belonging to an active container. The positioning phase serves to pack a subset of items already preselected by the selection phase. Then, both phases cooperate till packing all items into their corresponding containers. The second heuristic can be viewed as an extended version of the first one. Indeed, before deciding whether the current container is closed or a new container is activated, “a local reoptimization phase” is considered. Finally, both proposed heuristics are evaluated on a set of random instances obtained by using the standard generator scheme of the literature. The provided results show that both proposed heuristics remain competitive when compared to the results obtained by one of the best methods of the literature.},

The BRKGA is used to evolve the order in which the boxes are packed into the bins and the parameters used by the placement procedure. Two new placement heuristics are used to determine the bin and the free maximal space where each box is placed. A novel fitness function that improves significantly the solution quality is also developed. The new approach is extensively tested on 858 problem instances and compared with other approaches published in the literature. The computational experiment results demonstrate that the new approach consistently equals or outperforms the other approaches and the statistical analysis confirms that the approach is significantly better than all the other approaches.}

In this work we present a variable neighborhood descent (VND) inspired algorithm which improves the state-of-art biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA), proposed in [6], for the three-dimensional bin packing problem. The constructive greedy heuristic method to pack the boxes uses an integer sequence to establish the order of boxes to be packed. The presented BRKGA/VND variant fills the initial and mutant population based on sorted box sequences. The devised hybrid method shows significantly superior average fitness through the generations, therefore, solutions with high quality are found faster. The novel approach is tested with a standard set of 320 instances. The computational experiment demonstrate that BRKGA/VND produces equal or better results compared to other state-of-art algorithms proposed in the literature. The empirical data shows that BRKGA/VND hybrid variant systematically produces high quality solutions at fewer iterations compared to the results attained by BRKGA.}

  abstract = {We consider a real-world packing problem faced by a logistics company that loads and ships hundreds of trucks every day. For each shipment, the cargo has to be selected from a set of heterogeneous boxes. The goal of the resulting container loading problem (CLP) is to maximize the value of the cargo while satisfying a number of practical constraints to ensure safety and facilitate cargo handling, including customer priorities, load balancing, cargo stability, stacking constraints, positioning constraints, and limiting the number of unnecessary cargo move operations during multi-shipment deliveries. Although some of these constraints have been considered in the literature, this is the first time a problem tackles all of them jointly on real instances. Moreover, differently from the literature, we treat the unnecessary move operations as soft constraints and analyze their trade-off with the value maximization. As a result, the problem is inherently multi-objective and extremely challenging. We tackle it by proposing a randomized constructive heuristic that iteratively combines items in a preprocessing procedure, sorts them based on multiple criteria, uses randomization to partially perturb the sorting, and finally constructs the packing while complying with all the side constraints. We also propose dual bounds based on CLP relaxations. On large-scale industry instances, our algorithm runs in a few seconds and outperforms (in terms of value and constraints handling) both the solutions constructed manually by the company and those provided by a commercial software. The algorithm is currently used by the company generating significant economic and CO2 savings.}

The bins and cartons to be packed are assumed rectangular in shape. The cartons are allowed to be rotated into any one of the six positions that keep the carton edges parallel to the bin edges. This greatly increases the difficulty of finding a good solution since the search space expands significantly comparing to the 3D-BPP where the cartons have fixed orientations. A mathematical (mixed integer programming) approach is modified based on [Chen, C. S., Lee, S. M., Shen, Q. S., 1995. An analytical model for the container loading problem. European Journal of Operational Research 80 (1), 68–76] and numerical experiments indicate that the mathematical approach is not suitable for the variable bin height 3D-BPP. A special bin packing algorithm based on packing index is designed to utilize the special problem feature and is used as a building block for a genetic algorithm designed for the 3D-BPP. The paper also investigates the situation where more than one type of bin are used and provides a heuristic for packing a batch of cartons using the genetic algorithm. Numerical experiments show that our proposed method yields quick and satisfactory results when benchmarked against the actual packing practice and the MIP model with the latest version of CPLEX.}

However, over the years also some deficiencies of this typology became evident, which created problems in dealing with recent developments and prevented it from being accepted more generally. In this paper, the authors present an improved typology, which is partially based on Dyckhoff’s original ideas, but introduces new categorisation criteria, which define problem categories different from those of Dyckhoff. Furthermore, a new, consistent system of names is suggested for these problem categories. Finally, the practicability of the new scheme is demonstrated by using it as a basis for a categorisation of the C&P literature from the years between 1995 and 2004.}

This study proposes a defragmentation technique to combine the fragmented space into a continuous usable space, which potentially allows the packing of additional items. We illustrate the effectiveness of this technique using the two- and three-dimensional bin packing problem, where the aim is to load all given items (represented by rectangular boxes) into the minimum number of identical bins. Experimental results based on well-known 2D and 3D bin packing data sets show that our defragmentation technique alone is able to produce solutions approaching the quality of considerably more complex meta-heuristic approaches for the problem. In conjunction with a bin shuffling strategy for incremental improvement, our resultant algorithm outperforms all leading meta-heuristic approaches based on the commonly used benchmark data by a significant margin.}

The key to obtaining high quality solutions is to select the right block to place into the right free space cuboid (or residual space) in the container. We propose a new heuristic for evaluating the fitness of residual spaces, and use a tree search to decide the best residual space-block pair at each step. The resultant algorithm outperforms the best known algorithms based on the 1600 commonly used benchmark instances even when given fewer computational resources.

To facilitate loading/unloading operations, items of the same type packed into the same layer should be contiguous and at least one of them should be visible from the outside.

When a large number of units of a product have to be shipped, the company requires that homogeneous pallets, with only one product, are built first, then weakly heterogeneous pallets, in which each layer corresponds to a single product, and finally strongly heterogeneous pallets with the remaining units of the products. To be useful in practice, the solutions have to satisfy five types of constraints: geometric constraints, so that pallets are completely inside the trucks and do not overlap; weight constraints, limiting the total weight a truck can bear and the maximum weight supported by each axle; constraints limiting the position of the centre of gravity of the cargo; dynamic stability constraints, to avoid cargo displacement when the truck is moving; and constraints ensuring that the delivery dates of products are respected. We have developed a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure, including some improvement methods tailored to the problem, among them an adaptation of ejection chains.

Using a layer based column generation approach, we tackle vertical support using second order cone programming, and satisfy load bearing through a graph representation to trace load distribution. Additionally, we use industry data to propose an instance generator that produces realistic items with practical attributes such as support surface, load capacity, weight, and planogram sequence number.

  abstract="In this paper, we study a pallet building problem that originates from a case study in a company that produces robotized systems for freight transportation and logistics. The problem takes into account well-known constraints, such as rotation and stackability, and other specific constraints such as visibility and contiguity among items belonging to the same family. We formalize the problem and then solve it by means of a GRASP metaheuristic. The algorithm is based on an Extreme Points heuristic and a reactive mechanism. It uses a two-step strategy, in which items are first grouped into horizontal layers, and then layers are stacked one over the other to form pallets. The performance of the algorithm is assessed through extensive computational tests on real-world instances. The results show that the GRASP is able to create very compact packings for most of the instances with a limited computational effort.",

We propose new lower bounds which are used within a branch-and-bound algorithm for the exact solution of the problem. Extensive computational testing on problem instances from the literature involving up to 120 pieces shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {The Container Loading Problem (CLP) literature has traditionally guaranteed cargo static stability by imposing the full support constraint for the base of the box. Used as a proxy for real-world static stability, this constraint excessively restricts the container space utilization and has conditioned the algorithms developed for this problem. In this paper we propose a container loading algorithm with static stability constraints based on the static mechanical equilibrium conditions applied to rigid bodies, which derive from Newton’s laws of motion. The algorithm is a multi-population biased random-key genetic algorithm, with a new placement procedure that uses the maximal-spaces representation to manage empty spaces, and a layer building strategy to fill the maximal-spaces. The new static stability criterion is embedded in the placement procedure and in the evaluation function of the algorithm. The new algorithm is extensively tested on well-known literature benchmark instances using three variants: no stability constraint, the classical full base support constraint and with the new static stability constraint—a comparison is then made with the state-of-the-art algorithms for the CLP. The computational experiments show that by using the new stability criterion it is always possible to achieve a higher percentage of space utilization than with the classical full base support constraint, for all classes of problems, while still guaranteeing static stability. Moreover, for highly heterogeneous cargo the new algorithm with full base support constraint outperforms the other literature approaches, improving the best solutions known for these classes of problems.}

  abstract = {Container loading is a pivotal function for operating supply chains efficiently. Underperformance results in unnecessary costs (e.g. cost of additional containers to be shipped) and in an unsatisfactory customer service (e.g. violation of deadlines agreed to or set by clients). Thus, it is not surprising that container loading problems have been dealt with frequently in the operations research literature. It has been claimed though that the proposed approaches are of limited practical value since they do not pay enough attention to constraints encountered in practice. In this paper, a review of the state-of-the-art in the field of container loading will be given. We will identify factors which – from a practical point of view – need to be considered when dealing with container loading problems and we will analyze whether and how these factors are represented in methods for the solution of such problems. Modeling approaches, as well as exact and heuristic algorithms will be reviewed. This will allow for assessing the practical relevance of the research which has been carried out in the field. We will also mention several issues which have not been dealt with satisfactorily so far and give an outlook on future research opportunities.}

  abstract = {This paper presents a hybrid placement strategy for the three-dimensional strip packing problem which involves packing a set of cuboids (‘boxes’) into a three-dimensional bin (parallelepiped) of fixed width and height but unconstrained length (the ‘container’). The goal is to pack all of the boxes into the container, minimising its resulting length. This problem has potential industry application in stock cutting (wood, polystyrene, etc. – minimising wastage) and also cargo loading, as well as other applications in areas such as multi-dimensional resource scheduling. In addition to the proposed strategy a number of test results on available literature benchmark problems are presented and analysed. The results of empirical testing of the algorithm show that it out-performs other methods from the literature, consistently in terms of speed and solution quality-producing 28 best known results from 35 test cases.}
