\subsection*{Static stability}
Static stability or vertical support received most of its contributions from the fields of Pallet Loading Problems (PLP) and Cargo Loading Problems (CLP). In \citep{elhedhli2019three} a second order cone programming formulation was provided as a solution to a spacing problem between layers of a pallet. The pubblication further described the concept of minimizing the area of overlap between items of different layers to increase spacing between items of the same layer and increase the amount of potential support for higher layers.
In \citep{paquay2016mixed} a formulation of the CLP was given with practical constraints like weight distrubtiom, non-regular container shapes and vertical stability through vertex support.
