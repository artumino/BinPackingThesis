The problem addressed by our contribution is the 3D-SBSBPP (3D Single Bin-Size Bin Packing Problem) which is strongly NP-hard and is the generalization of the one-dimensional bin packing problem \citep{martello2000three}.

\section*{Case study}
\label{sec:intro:case_study}%
The work in this thesis stems from the case study of 

\section*{Overview}
\label{sec:intro:overview}%
The thesis is structured as follows. 
In \cref{chapter:literature} we review the relevant literature on the three-dimensional bin packing problem and the cutting and packing problems dealing with vertical support.
In \cref{chapter:problem} we give a formal definition of the problem and formulate a mixed-integer linear programming model that we'll use to validate the proposed solutions of the thesis.
Since the model can not be used to solve real instances in \cref{chapter:heuristics} we proposed an heuristic algorithm that addresses the problem.
Results from comparing our heuristic to relevant heuristics from the literature, validation with a direct comparison to the solutions from the proposed MILP model and solutions to real-world instances are described in \cref{chapther:experiments}, together with sources to new benchmark instances generated.
In \cref{chapther:conclusions} we give final remarks and list further developments about the work of the thesis.
